            EMC I.T. Solutions was started in 2017 as the natural progression for Damon Galt, President of EMC ITS.  
            He acquired his existing clients in a friendly separation from his old company so he could focus exclusively on providing services to Businesses, 
            and to grow the staff and expertise. Revenues have since doubled, staff grown, and senior level team members have been added.
